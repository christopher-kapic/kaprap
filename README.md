# KapRap
Webapp to speed up writing raps by suggesting rhymes

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d3119980-98f9-4685-9950-571fc4e5d4b3/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/kaprap/deploys)

Plan:
* experiment with hosting a site on Firebase
* allow users to save raps on their profile
* somehow link raps to SoundCloud (or something of that nature)

Current state:
 * simple JavaScript, HTML, CSS (vanilla) webapp
 * ugly at the moment; I just wanted to get functionality working
 * uses the [Rhymebrain](https://rhymebrain.com/) API
